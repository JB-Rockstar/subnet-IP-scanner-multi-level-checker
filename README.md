## Subnet IP Availability Scanner with Multi-Level Checks (Ping, SSH, Control Panel)

This Python-based tool identifies all empty, clean, and unused IP addresses within a given subnet. It offers a GUI for ease of use and provides three optional checks: pinging to detect active IPs, SSH connection testing to predefined ports, and control panel verification to check the IPâ€™s history in the data center. The tool allows users to choose any combination of these checks and outputs the available IPs in a CSV file, making it ideal for administrators managing network resources in data centers.
